## CharCount

This simple program was requested of me for a job interview February 2017. The requirements were:
* Use any development platform/language of your choosing (they are a .Net company so I chose C#).
* Allow the user to enter multiple sentences of text.
* Include a button that the user can click after entering their desired text (I also included the ability to automatically update).
* When the user clicks the button, the application should analyze the text (that was entered by the user) and display (to the user) the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet.

(I got the job).
